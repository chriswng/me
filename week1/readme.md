TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

trying to move ahead with the work but I kep getting the error "but no encoding declared" rip

gotta ask tutor after Ben finishes his demo

cd.. to move up a level

ls to check where ur at

type "cd course"
    or whatever folder, to move into it

lots of errors so far, mostly due to mac. it's quite tragic :( python why :(

OOOOOH ok so use "python3" instead of "python" from here on

git add .
    #dot means current folder

git commit -m
"message for git"

git push
    login
