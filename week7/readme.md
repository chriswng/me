TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.


HOW TO READ EXCEL FILE:

xls_data = pd.read_excel("untitled spreadsheet.xlsx", skiprows=3, sheet_name= "BITRE_Fatal_Crash)
    google pandas read.excel

    sheet_name : to pull specific sheets

    
    skip_rows : rows to skip


This week we began our open data projects.

A daunting task.

I begin with importing my main csv regarding fatal crash data in australia from the past few decades. My first challenge was trying to extract and plot the time of crash from all the results. Main issue here was trying to take out hh:mm format into minutes.

In terms of direction I seek to incorporate more dataets related to the task to create extensions of content.
