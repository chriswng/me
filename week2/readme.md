TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.


Currently almost finished with exercise one
# break is there to help you clarify your own code in the debugging process


if s = "text"
use 
s.upper()
s.lower()
etc


Yeet, just add the the space


ex1 has been done and dusted.

ex2 has been done. It was a slippery one hehe

notice spelling errors with def, with[] and others

ex3 is very interesting rn

6%3 = 0
5%2 = 1
9%5 = 4
%modulo

elif is not else
    elif is a parallel if where as else is capturing everything else

    return only works inside a def func?



    oh geez rmbr to look back
    see how u just had to *10 for the loop 3

#loop5
cordy = line
what this does is thatke the coordinates lists but split it up into chunks


#loop6
accidentally found the answer but not sure why (num)*1 made it work ... 

#will have ot chase it up

#loop 7
really think creatively about what u need done

#chase up the unused variables
